                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Andres. I'm a 3rd year applied math transfer and a veteran.
                    My partner's name is Tori and recently visited home for 
                    the weekend. Her major is AGPM and she enjoys playing Overwatch.
                    Tori recently saw the Super Mario movie and liked Jack Black's singing. She also
                    worked at a French bakery last Summer where she learned how to
                    make ratatouille.

					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>The objective of the lab was to collaborate with a partner 
                        and to format a page with unique coloring for the heading, body, background,
                        and border.
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that arose in the process of this lab, was that my box 
                        that contained information about my partner wasn't aligning correctly.
                        This was because I had extra instructions in my css file that I had copied 
                        from the screenshot that needed to be removed. Another problem that I had was
                        that I had connected the wrong folder in vscode, so when it was time to push 
                        in github I pushed the wrong file. Somewhere in this hic up I lost my html file 
                        and had to start over. Luckily this was before I called my partner and redid the 
                        lab.
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went pretty well. Completing the reading assignment beforehand
                        allowed for me and my parner to be on the same page and break the ice. Working in 
                        the lab session was a bit informal, however we were efficient and came up with some
                        good ideas and landed on making Mario and Luigi themed pages.

                        The lab was a success.
