			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Write pseudocode to describe a process that a student would do. We also wrote pseudocode for rock, paper, scissor.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Formatting the pseudocode to look how I wanted was an issue that arose when viewing the html file locally. 
						I used the linebreak tag for each individual line, and eventually used the pre tag.
